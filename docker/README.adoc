=== FAQ

- *Can't access port 8080?* +
  The built-in main `application.properties` defines `server.address=localhost`, therefore this port can't be exported to the host system. The Dockerfile of
  ProjectForge attaches an additional `application.properties` to the container which overrides `server.address=0.0.0.0`. +
  Through the `docker run` option `-p 8080:8080` the port is exported to the host.
