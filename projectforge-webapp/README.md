# Building the WebApp

## Building with yarn/npm
1. Before running the app you need to install the dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`.
2. Then you can build the webapp via `yarn build` or `npm run build`.

## Development with hot-code-replacement (recommended)
1. Start ProjectForge. See [ProjectForge ReadMe](../README.adoc)
2. Start web server with hot-code-replacement:
   1. Run `yarn start` or `npm start` in terminal.
   2. Open browser (if not started automatically) on yarn/npm port (default is 3000).
   
Now you can modify the Web files directly in the directory ```projectforge-webapp``` and
any change is automatically deployed instantly for your web browser.
