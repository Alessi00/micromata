Security issues of pentests, DataTransfer improved.

- 2FA (use SMS, mail, Authenticator app or Webauthn/Fido2 as 2nd factor for much more security.)
- Password reset for users implemented (it's only usable for users with configured 2FA / mail isn't supported for password reset due to security reasons).
- Scripts may be executed by users/groups without special rights (sudo functionality is supported). You may configure reports e. g. for project managers including financial data.
- mass update and selection of invoices for e. g. bank transfers etc.
- Datatransfer:
  * Multiple upload with progress bars implemented. Very nice.
  * Multi selection of files for deletion and download.
  * Audit on areas added (for seeing what happened)
  * E-mail notifications improved: files being deleted and audit log on areas.
