== Introduction

This documents describes the administration of ProjectForge®.

== ProjectForge Setup

=== Database

[source,shell,linenums]
----
#JDBC Java class
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
#spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver

#Database user
spring.datasource.username=sa

#Database password for given user

----

=== Initialization, first login and set-up dialogue

After the first start of ProjectForge® you will see
ProjectForge®'s set-up dialogue. Please configure at minimum the
adminstrator's password and the target (empty data-base for a productive
system or pre-filled with test data). You can configure or change all
other settings such as time zone, e-mail addresses etc. any time later.

=== PostgreSQL


==== Setting up the database

. Edit `postgresql.conf:` `max_connections =  50                   # (change requires restart)`
. `createuser -U postgres -P projectforge` as e.g. admin user.
. `createdb -U postgres -E UTF-8 -O projectforge projectforge` as e.g.
admin user.
. You can drop any existing user and database
with: `dropdb projectforge` and `dropuser projectforge`
. *Re-use of existing database (use a dump --> 5.5 or 5.6)*  +
`psql -q -f projectforge_2008-04-02_02-00.sql -U postgres projectforge 2>&1 > log.txt`

== Configuration

=== Base directory (application's home)

ProjectForge® needs a base directory which is set
in `application.properties` of the web server. By default it
is `${user.home}/ProjectForge` . You should prepare this directory for
use-age of ProjectForge®. The following directories will be created
if not exist:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|`ProjectForge/hibernate-search` |Here the lucene indices are stored. If
corrupted, delete all files and directories in this directory and
re-build data base indices via the web admin console.

|`ProjectForge/resources/fonts` |For additional fonts used e. g. by the
pdf renderers.

|`ProjectForge/resources/images` |For images e. g. by the pdf renderers.

|`ProjectForge/work` |For uploaded files etc. +
 +
|===

=== Configuration file application.properties

ProjectForge® is a SpringBoot-Application, you can get more
information http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html[here].

The format of the file is:

*File:* `application.properties`:
https://github.com/micromata/projectforge/blob/develop/projectforge-business/src/main/resources/application.properties[here]

=== Customization

==== Logo ant title in pdf outputs

At default the pdf outputs file is not present. The logo is placed at
the top right.  +
Under the configuration menu of the web application you can enter your
organization name. This name will be used as headline for the pdf
outputs.

[source,shell,linenums]
----
The files must be located in the Resources/Images folder.
----

*File:* `application.properties`:

[source,shell,linenums]
----
...
projectforge.logoFile=
projectforge.export.logoFile=
...
----

=== Configuration settings (web interface)

Please go to this page for setting different parameters of
ProjectForge® such as default time zone etc. You'll find the
documentation there.

=== Using ttf fonts for PDF render engine

FOP is used as internal render engine. For enabling True Type Fonts
please refer the FOP documentation.

[source,shell,linenums]
----
java -cp build/fop.jar:lib/avalon-framework-4.2.0.jar:lib/commons-logging-1.0.4.jar:lib/commons-io-1.3.1.jar \ +
          org.apache.fop.fonts.apps.PFMReader <path>/<font>.pfm ttf<font>.xml
----

=== HTML formatted E-Mail templates

ProjectForge works with Groovy templates for generating e-mails (as
notifications). You'll find the templates inside your web archive of the
ProjectForge
installation: `plugins/projectforge-business-X.X.X.jar/mail/.` You can
modify any template of this directory if needed by simply copiing the
file(s) you want to modify into your ProjectForge application dir, which
is also the destination of `application.properties:`

    cp projectforge-business-X.X.X.jar/mail/

Afterwards you can edit this file. ProjectForge looks first in this
ProjectForge app directory for loading templates and if not found it
uses the resources path.

The templates are internationalized with the locale of the receiving
user.

[source,html,linenums]
----
<html>
<html>
#INCLUDE{mail/mailHead.html}
<body>
#INCLUDE{mail/mailOpening.html}
<br />
Here you can place content (don't forget to use i18n keys for supporting internationalized e-mails).
...
<br />
<%= pf.getString("link") %>: <a href="${requestUrl}">${requestUrl}</a>
<br />
This is an example of using dynamic data (here a list of positions will be printed):
<table>
  <% for (position in order.positions) { %>
    <tr>
      <th><%= pf.getString("title") %></th>
      <td>${position.title}</td>
      ...
    </tr>
  <% } %>
</table>

#INCLUDE{mail/mailHistoryTable.html}

#INCLUDE{mail/mailClosing.html}
#INCLUDE{mail/mailFooter.html}
</body>
</html>
----

If you don't like html-formatted e-mails, you can simply remove all html
tags (ignore the html suffix then).

=== Configuration of Mobile Enterprise Blogging (MEB)

ProjectForge supports two ways of receiving SMS: e-mail and/or
servlet-call. You can use both or at least one of the two ways:

*File:* `application.properties`

[source,shell,linenums]
----
...
projectforge.receiveSmsKey=*******SECRET********
...
----

ProjectForges ensures that messages will be imported only once.

==== E-Mail

ProjectForge can receive messages from a mail server (e. g. IMAP mail
account). The e-mails will be parsed as key-value:

[source,shell,linenums]
----
#Alias to public url
cfg.public.url=http://localhost:8080
mail.session.pfmailsession.name=pfmailsession
mail.session.pfmailsession.emailEnabled=true

#A standard sender email address. The application may use another one
mail.session.pfmailsession.standardEmailSender=sender@yourserver.org

#Mail protocol: Plain, StartTLS,SSL
mail.session.pfmailsession.encryption=Plain

#Hostname of the email server
mail.session.pfmailsession.smtp.host=mail.yourserver.org

#Port number of the email server
mail.session.pfmailsession.smtp.port=25

#The email server needs authentification
mail.session.pfmailsession.smtp.auth=false

#Authentification by user name
mail.session.pfmailsession.smtp.user=

#Users password
mail.session.pfmailsession.smtp.password=
----

==== Servlet-Call

You can implement a servlet call whenever your system receives an
SMS:  +
`https://pf.acme.com/secure/SMSReceiver?key=kds8uijkqw6idg&date=20101105171233&sender=01234567&msg=Hello...`  +
The format of the values are the same as described above. The encoding
should be UTF-8. The key is a communication key and should be configured
in your  (see above).  +
Please deploy the following php script on your Asterisk web server (many
thanks to Thomas Koch for this great work):

=== Asterisk connection: phone calls and texting with ProjectForge

==== Phone calls

If configured the users are able to initiate phone calls directly by
clicking on a phone number of an address or by entering a name or a
phone number in the direct phone call
page.

=== business assessment / BWA

If you work with accounting records (DATEV) you may be want to have
business assessments (BWA in German). The business assessments of DATEV
constist of rows. Each row has a line number (no) and a title (for
displaying). The `accountRange` defines which DATEV accounts matches the
row. Please note, that a record is assigned to the first row found.  +
If the priorty of a row is not high, the row will not be shown in the
short form of business assessments. The value defines row amounts which
are calculated (see example below).

=== SecurityConfig

==== Secure passwords

Every password is stored in the database as SHA256 hashed password. For
reducing brute force attacks several security mechanism are implemented.

==== Protection against brute force attacks

If the user login failed (via web page or rest service) a penalty time
is given for usernames and IP addresses. For every failed login for an
username the penalty time is increased by one second before the next try
of an username/password combination for that username is allowed.  +
The same mechanism is used for failed login failures from an IP address
(one second penalty per thousand failed logins).  +
Please refer the source code for more information.

==== Salted passwords

Since version 5.3 of ProjectForge® salted passwords are used. This
means, that every password is first concatenated with an salt value
(random string per user) and then hashed. Therefore so called rainbow
tables are useless for attacking passwords. After migrating to version
5.3 every password is salted after login of the user or if the user is
changing his password.

==== Salted passwords with pepper

Since version 5.3 of ProjectForge® the administrator is able to
configure a pepper string in the `application.properties`. Before
hashing a password the pepper string is concatenated to the salt and
password. Therefore no brute force attack is possible if an attacker has
access to the database dump etc.  +
Please configure the pepper string like this:

*File:* `application.properties:`

[source,shell,linenums]
----
...
projectforge.security.passwordPepper=*******SECRET********
....
----

All passwords are automatically updated after any login of an user (if
no pepper and/or salt was yet used for the user's password) or after any
password change.

=== LDAP

==== Requirements

The LDAP must support the following additional schemas (example of
slapd.conf of OpenLDAP):

[source,shell,linenums]
----
include /sw/etc/openldap/schema/cosine.schema +
include /sw/etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema
----

==== Configuration

The groupBase setting is only needed in master mode. The managerUser is
not needed in simple slave mode. For further information see below.

*File:* `application.properties:`

[source,shell,linenums]
----
...
projectforge.ldap.server=
projectforge.ldap.baseDN=
projectforge.ldap.managerUser=
projectforge.ldap.managerPassword=
projectforge.ldap.port=
projectforge.ldap.sslCertificateFile=
projectforge.ldap.groupBase=
projectforge.ldap.userBase=
projectforge.ldap.authentication=
projectforge.ldap.posixAccountsDefaultGidNumber=
projectforge.ldap.sambaAccountsSIDPrefix=
projectforge.ldap.sambaAccountsPrimaryGroupSID=
...
----

==== Local (admin) users

Please login by using the stay-logged-in checkbox on the login screen as
administrator (no LDAP should be configured). Restart ProjectForge with
LDAP configured and use the same browser. You should be logged-in.
Please go to the user list and select option local user for every user
who should be authenticated against ProjectForge (instead of LDAP) and
save them. Now the local users may log-in without LDAP credentials. This
is especially use-ful for administrator users of ProjectForge.

==== LDAP over SSL

`openssl s_client -showcerts -connect ldap.acme.priv:636 > ldap.pem` Copy
the lines
including `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` until `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` (including)
to a file called `ldap.cert.` Now you can configure the certificate file
in `application.properties` or you can import the certificate to your
java keystore. The first solution is independent of your JAVA version
and is recommended first.

==== ProjectForge as LDAP master

The LDAP master mode is the most tested mode of ProjectForge and is used
in production mode at the ProjectForge developer's company. In this
mode, ProjectForge needs a LDAP user with write access to groups and
users. The ProjectForge user's will be synchronized in LDAP. If there is
any conflict between LDAP and ProjectForge, the ProjectForge settings
are used. The configuration of this mode is simple:

*File:* `application.properties:`

[source,shell,linenums]
----
...
projectforge.login.handlerClass=LdapMasterLoginHandler
...
----

. This LDAP login handler has read-write access to the LDAP server and
acts as master of the user and group data. All changes of ProjectForge's
users and groups will be written through.
. Any change of the LDAP server will be ignored and may be overwritten
by ProjectForge.
. *Passwords*  +
After each successful login-in at ProjectForge (via LoginForm)
ProjectForges tries to authenticate the user with the given
username/password credentials at LDAP. If the LDAP authentication fails
ProjectForge changes the password with the actual password of the user
(given in the LoginForm). If the user changes his password (my account
-> change password), the LDAP password will be changed respectively. In
LDAP master mode, the user is also able to change his "WLAN/Samba
password" (my account -> change password). The password entered there,
will be written to the LDAP attribute "sambaNTPassword".
. *Deactivated users*  +
Deactivated users will be moved to an sub userbase called "deactivated".
The e-mail will be invalidated and the password will be deleted. Deleted
and deactivated users are removed from any LDAP group. After
reactivating the user, the password has to be reset if the user logins
the next time via LoginForm.
. *Deleted Users*  +
Deleted users will not be synchronized and removed in LDAP if exist.
. *New users*  +
New users (created with ProjectForge's UserEditPage) will be created
first without password in the LDAP system directly but with "WLAN/Samba
password". Such users need to log-in first at ProjectForge, otherwise
their LDAP passwords aren't set (no log-in at any other system
connecting to the LDAP is possible until the first log-in at
ProjectForge).
. *Modifiing fields in LDAP*  +
ProjectForge does only modify supported fields of known LDAP users. If
any modification is done in LDAP of fields and users/groups known by
ProjectForge they will be overwritten by ProjectForge during the next
synchronization run. If any modification in other fields of LDAP users
are done, the should be left untouched by ProjectForge.
. *Synchronization*  +
After any modification of any ProjectForge user or group, the
synchronization is started for all LDAP users and groups. If no
modification is done, the synchronization is done approximately hourly,
but only if any user activity is detected in ProjectForge. You can force
a synchronization by refreshing all caches (including the
UserGroupCache) in the system web page or by restarting ProjectForge.
. *Groups and assigned users*  +
Users will be added as `uniqueMember` entries in the LDAP groups if also
assigned in ProjectForge to the same ProjectForge group.

===== LDAP entries

See figures [.external-link]#3# and [.external-link]#4# for detailled
information of how does ProjectForge stores and expect LDAP fields and
object classes.

image::/uploads/adminguide/LDAP-user-entry.png[image]

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 3: |ProjectForge uses the fields and object classes shown in
this figure for users. The object class `posixAccount` with the
fields `uidNumber, gidNumber, homeDirectory` and `loginShell` are only
used and managed if configured).
The field `employeeNumber` is used by ProjectForge for storing the
primary key of the ProjectForge user entry in LDAP (for a better
syncronization). So the renaming of user names should work.
|===

image::/uploads/adminguide/LDAP-group-entry.png[image]

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 4: |ProjectForge uses the fields and object classes shown in
this figure for groups. The field `businessCategory` is used by
ProjectForge for storing the primary key of the ProjectForge group entry
in LDAP (for a better syncronization). So the renaming of group names
should work.
|===

===== Managing POSIX accounts

ProjectForge supports the management of POSIX accounts with the
data `uidNumber,` `gidNumber,` `homeDirectory,` and `loginShell.`

You can adminster the POSIX account data in the UserEditPage after
configuring the *`application.properties`* like the above example.
Pleaser refer the tool-tips for further information:

image::/uploads/adminguide/LDAP-POSIX-accounts.png[image]

[cols="1,4",]
|===
|Figure 5: |ProjectForge is able to manage POSIX accounts in LDAP
master mode.
|===

* After clicking the Button `create` beside the UID number field
ProjectForge will prefill all POSIX account fields:
. The UID number will be the next free number (ProjectForge searches the
highest used UID and increments it by one). If no such number found,
1,000 is assumed.
. The GID number will be preset with the defaultGidNumber configured
in `application.properties`.
. The home directory will be the prefix `/home/` (configured
in `application.properties`) followed by the user-name: e. g. `/home/kai`
. The login-shell will be preset with `/bin/bash` or any other which is
configured in `application.properties`.
+
Don't forge to save this user by clicking the save or update button on
the bottom of the edit page. After changing any of these POSIX account
fields the LDAP entries are update immediately.
* ProjectForge presets a new UID number automatically (see above).
* ProjectForge assures that no UID number is given twice.
* Every LDAP entry gets the `object-class` `posixAccount` only if the
POSIX account data were created in ProjectForge for this user.

==== Managing Samba accounts

|Figure 6: |ProjectForge is able to manage POSIX and Samba accounts in
LDAP master mode.
|===

* After clicking the Button `create` beside the UID number field
ProjectForge will prefill all SAMBA account fields:
. The UID number will be the next free number (ProjectForge searches the
highest used UID and increments it by one). If no such number found,
1,000 is assumed.
. The GID number will be preset with the defaultSambaPrimaryGroupSID
configured in `application.properties`.
. Parallel usage with *POSIX, which is recommended:*  +
Please click the 'create' button near to the UID of the POSIX account,
the suffix of SAMBASID will be the same UID. ProjectForge's tries first
to get the same UID for SAMBA as for POSIX if no conflict was found.
+
Don't forge to save this user by clicking the save or update button on
the bottom of the edit page. After changing any of these Samba account
fields the LDAP entries are update immediately.
* Every LDAP entry gets the `object-class` `sambaSamAccount` only if the
Samba account data were created in ProjectForge for this user.

==== ProjectForge as LDAP client

This LDAP login handler acts as a LDAP slave, meaning, that LDAP will be
accessed in read-only mode. There are 3 modes
available: `simple,` `users` and `users-groups.` The configuration of
this mode is simple:

*File:* `application.properties`:

[source,shell,linenums]
----
...
projectforge.login.handlerClass=LdapSlaveLoginHandler
...
----

===== Simple mode

The simple mode is assumed if no ldap managerUser is given in the
application.properties.

* Simple means that only username and password is checked, all other
user settings such as assigned groups and user name etc. are managed by
ProjectForge.
* No ldap user is needed for accessing users or groups of LDAP, only the
user's login-name and password is checked by trying to authenticate!
* If a user is deactivated in LDAP the user has the possibility to work
with ProjectForge unlimited as long as he uses his
stay-logged-in-method! (If not acceptable please use the normal user
mode instead.)
* For local users any LDAP setting is ignored.

===== Users mode

The normal user mode is assumed if a LDAP managerUser is given in
the `application.properties.`

* Normal means that username and password is checked and all other user
settings such as user name etc. are read by a given LDAP manager user.
* If a user is deleted in LDAP the user will be marked as deleted also
in ProjectForge's data-base. Any login after synchronizing isn't allowed
(the stay-logged-in-feature fails also for deleted users).
* For local users any LDAP setting is ignored.
* All known LDAP user fields of the users are synchronized (given name,
surname, e-mail etc.).

===== Users-groups mode

This mode is not yet implemented, the users-mode is used instead.

==== ProjectForge without LDAP

You can also use PF without LADP.

=== XML-backup and restore and data-base migration ( BUG --> We guarantee no guarantee, but work on the solution of the problem )

ProjectForge supports the import and export of its whole data-base as
XML. It's independent from the data-base (Hypersonic, PostgreSQL, MySQL,
Oracle etc.). You can choose this method to migrate your data-base from
one data-base to any other data-base supported by ProjectForge.

==== Export

It's possible to export an XML-Dump from your data-base using the system
administration dialogue (web). This backup contains all data of
ProjectForge in one zipped xml file.

==== Import

. First you need a fresh data-base (without any tables and data).
. Afterwards start ProjectForge with the connection data to your new
data-base.
. Upload the XML or zipped XML file inside the setup-page (which is
shown automatically in your web-browser for empty data-bases). Leave any
other input fields such as password etc. untouched.
. Press the upload button.
. Watch the results in the log messages. ProjectForge will verify each
single entry by comparing each object of the XML file with the imported
data-base objects (each single field of every object is compared.) Any
inconsistency or difference is shown in the log file.
. Now you can login into ProjectForge.

==== Limitations

The limitation is the web servers memory. It's planned to support very
large ProjectForge data-bases using different xml files. Please request
this feature e. g. inside the help forum if needed. For migration
without changing the data-base vendor the data-base specific dump and
restore mechanism are recommended for large data-bases.

**Hint**

____
Please note: After an import of a dump file into a new ProjectForge
installation all primary keys are changed! ProjectForge ensures the
integrity of all data including the history entries.
____

=== Backup

All datasets of ProjectForge® will be stored in the underlaying
database (e. g. PostgreSQL).  +
You should install an Unix cron script making frequently a backup of the
database. A dump of containing table entries as SQL statements for
PostgreSQL is possible by using:

[cols=",",]
|===
|  |pg_dump -D -U projectforge -f pf_dump_`date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M'`.sql
|===

=== Restoring a backup

[source,shell,linenums]
----
psql -q -f projectforge_2008-05-12_02-00.sql -U postgres projectforge 2>&1 > log.txt
----

For further details concerning dropping and creating a new data base.  +
Don't forget to create indices (thru admin web page)!

**Hint**

____
If you want to use productive data in your develepment system for
testing, it's recommended to set all e-mail addresses of the users to
your developers e-mail. Also all passwords can be easily set
to `test123` if you user folliwing sql statement in your test database
(not productive!):
____

[source,sql,linenums]
----
update t_pf_user SET password='SHA\{BC871652288E56E306CFA093BEFC3FFCD0ED8872}', email='m.developer@acme.com/';
----

=== Automatical backup

==== Backup script

Install crontab entry as user projectforge on your ProjectForge®
server starting the following script:

*File:* `pforgebackup.sh:`

[source,shell,linenums]
----
#!/bin/bash

PGSQL_DIR=/usr/bin
BACKUPDIR=/home/projectforge/backup
BASENAME=projectforge PASSWD=...

echo Starting backup of ProjectForge ...
BACKUPFILE=$BACKUPDIR/${BASENAME}_`date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M'`.sql

echo Using filename $BACKUPFILE ...
echo Exporting ...
$PGSQL_DIR/pg_dump -D -U projectforge -W $PASSWD -f $BACKUPFILE

echo Zipping backupfile ...
gzip $BACKUPFILE

# For using scp for remote backup:
#scp $BACKUPFILE <user>@backup.mydomain:backup/

echo Deleting backups older than 14 days
find $BACKUPDIR -mtime +14 | xargs rm

echo Backup of ProjectForge finished.
----

For allowing `pg_dump` without prompting password (if set), you can add
the following line to:

*File:* `pg_hba.conf:`

[source,shell,linenums]
----
local projectforge projectforge ident sameuser
----

==== Adding crontab

Adding following entry to the Unix crontab:

[source,shell,linenums]
----
# run every day at 2:00 am +
0 2 * * * /home/projectforge/bin/pforgebackup.sh
----

==== Remote backup

For remote backup via `scp` you need to use key authorization:

. Generate keys (using empty password) ssh-keygen
. Copy your public key, e. g. `identity.pub` to your backup server.
. Add this key on the backup server to the authorized keys.

==== Polling remote backup

For security reasons it's also possible to get the backup files from the
ProjectForge® server with a cronjob starting e. g. one hour later:

*File:* `pforgePollBackup.sh`:

....
#!/bin/bash
SERVER=projectforge.mydomain
DIR=/home/projectforge/backup
REMOTE_DIR=backup REMOTE_USER=projectforge
rsync -avz -e "ssh -P" -C $REMOTE_USER@$SERVER:$REMOTE_DIR $DIR
....

In that case you have to generate ssh key on your backup server and to
add it to the authorized keys on your ProjectForge® server. +
Add the following entry to your crontab on the backup server:
# run every day at 3:00 am 0 3 * * * /home/projectforge/bin/pforgePollBackup.sh

=== Monitoring

You may monitor the login page with your monitoring tool (such as
Nagios). If ProjectForge® is up and running and is full available
the following comment is included in the login page:

[source,shell,linenums]
----
<-- ProjectForge is alive. -->
----

If ProjectForge® isn't full available the following html comment is
embedded:

[source,shell,linenums]
----
<-- ProjectForge is not full available (perhaps in maintenance mode or in start-up phase). -->
----

=== Scheduler

==== Data base search index

The re-index job starts every night at 4 AM (UTC). If an error occurs an
e-mail is sent to the admin e-mail addresses configured via web
administration. If not configured, no e-mail is sent.

=== Uninstalling ProjectForge

You only need to delete the Jar-File and the working directory you've
chosen / configured. If you're not sure, where ProjectForge's working
directory is located, please restart ProjectForge and see for the
directory in the log output or configuration tab of the standalone
version.

**Hint**

Please note: If you delete the working directory, all your data base
entries are deleted as well!

=== Structure of the attrschema.xml file

. `AttrSchema`: The `<entry>` element corresponds to a database entity.
At the moment only `employee` is supported.
. `AttrGroup`: Within each `<entry>` element there is a `<list>` which
can contain multiple
`<bean class="de.micromata.genome.db.jpa.tabattr.api.AttrGroup">`
elements. Each of these elements is shown as a panel in the
corresponding edit page (see screenshot of the employee edit page). Each
element has multiple `<property>` sub elements which are describing this
group/panel:
.. `<property name="type" value="..."/>` valid values of the attribute
`value` are `NOT_TIMEABLE`, `PERIOD` and `INSTANT_OF_TIME`. Both
`PERIOD` and `INSTANT_OF_TIME` have in common that in the web interface
you can add/change/delete multiple entries for different dates. Compared
to `NOT_TIMEABLE` the panels of these two types have additional UI
elements for these purposes.
... `NOT_TIMEABLE`: This value is designated for a group of regular
fields which are not time-dependent.
... `PERIOD`: This value is designated for a group of fields whose
values are valid for a certain period. This period starts at the date
which is selected in the web interface and it ends at the date of the
nearest successor entry. If there is no successor entry, than it's end
is open. At the moment, the only granularity is day. _Example: An
employee has the tax bracket 1 since 01.01.2016. As of 01.01.2017 it
will have the tax bracket 4._
... `INSTANT_OF_TIME` This value is designated for a group of fields
whose values are valid for a certain instant of time, which is selected
in the web interface. At the moment, the only granularity is day.
_Example: An employee has worked on sunday 11.06.2016 for 10 hours._
.. `<property name="name" value="..."/>` The value must be a string. It
is used as the first part of the html ID of all input fields of the
panel. Therefore it must follow the rules for valid html IDs.
Furthermore it must be unique within each `AttrSchema` because it is
used as a key in the database.
.. `<property name="i18nKey" value="..."/>` The value must be an i18n
key.
It's translation is shown in the heading of the panel.
.. `<property name="i18nKeyStartTime" value="..."/>` This property is
only required for `PERIOD` and `INSTANT_OF_TIME`. It is an i18n key
whose translation is shown to the left of the datepicker in the panel.
Typical values are `attr.validFrom` for `PERIOD` and
`attr.instantOfTime` for `INSTANT_OF_TIME`.
.. `<property name="descriptions">` This is a `<list>` of
`<bean class="de.micromata.genome.db.jpa.tabattr.api.AttrDescription">`
elements, each of them describing one field of the panel.
. `AttrDescription`: Each element has multiple `<property>` sub elements
which are describing this field:
.. `<property name="propertyName" value="..."/>` The value must be a
string. It is used as the second part of the html ID of this field.
Therefore it must follow the rules for valid html IDs. Furthermore it
must be unique within each `AttrGroup` for `PERIOD` and
`INSTANT_OF_TIME` and unique within each `AttrSchema` for `NOT_TIMEABLE`
because it is used as a key in the database.
.. `<property name="i18nkey" value="..."/>` This is the i18n key of the
field. It is shown to it's left.
.. `<property name="required" value="..."/>` Valid values are `true` and
`false`. This property is optional. If it is omitted is has the same
effect as set to `false`.
... `true`: The field must be filled in the web interface.
... `false`: The field does not need to be filled.
.. `<property name="wicketComponentFactoryClass">` This describes what
kind of field should be generated. These are the possible sub elements:
... `<bean class="org.projectforge.web.common.timeattr.IntegerAttrWicketComponentFactory"/>`
This will create a number field of type Integer. The following optional
properties can be used to restrict the input:
`<property name="minIntValue" value="..."/>` and
`<property name="maxIntValue" value="..."/>` . Furthermore this property
must be set: `<property name="type" value="java.lang.Integer"/>`.
... `<bean class="org.projectforge.web.common.timeattr.BigDecimalAttrWicketComponentFactory"/>`
This will create a number field of type BigDecimal. The following
optional properties can be used to restrict the input:
`<property name="minIntValue" value="..."/>` and
`<property name="maxIntValue" value="..."/>`. Furthermore this property
must be set: `<property name="type" value="java.math.BigDecimal"/>`.
... `<bean class="org.projectforge.web.common.timeattr.StringAttrWicketComponentFactory"/>`
This will create a text field of type String. The following optional
property can be used to restrict the length of the input:
`<property name="maxLength" value="..."/>` (see the example).
Furthermore this property must be set:
`<property name="type" value="java.lang.String"/>`.
... `<bean class="org.projectforge.web.common.timeattr.DropDownAttrWicketComponentFactory">`
This will create a drop down menu. The example above shows how the
options can be added to it. The options must be i18n keys which will be
translated for the web interface. Furthermore this property must be set:
`<property name="type" value="java.lang.String"/>`.
... `<bean class="org.projectforge.web.common.timeattr.DateAttrWicketComponentFactory">`
This will create a date picker. The example above shows how the options
can be added to it. Furthermore this property must be set:
`<property name="type" value="java.util.Date"/>`.
... `<bean class="org.projectforge.web.common.timeattr.BooleanAttrWicketComponentFactory">`
This will create a CheckBoxPanel. The example above shows how the
options can be added to it. Furthermore this property must be set:
`<property name="type" value="java.util.Boolean"/>`.
