== Migration guide

Most migrations (data base as well as data base content) will be done automatically during the start-up phase of an newer version.

But there are some really small changes e. g. in config files etc. which have to be done manually, as described below.

====

====

=== Version 7.2.1

. Scripting
.. The scripting functionality is fully migrated to React. Multiple attachmentes are now supported. Therefore the files
has to be addressed via ``files.file` instead of `file` (Kotlin) or `script.file` (Groovy) or by `files.getFile("abcdef.xlsx")`.
Also filenames will be accessible via 'files.filename' instead of `filename' (Kotlin) or `script.filename`. All bindings
will be done automatically for the Kotlin script (of not already there). Multiple imports will be prevented by auto-inserting of
imports (and bindings).

=== Version 6.x to version 7

. Configurationparameters changed
.. `config.xml:holiday.month` is now 1-based (1 - January, ..., 12 - December), was 0-based.
.. `projectforge.properties:projectforge.defaultFirstDayOfWeek=MONDAY` (full name of weekday: SUNDAY, ...)

. Configuration parameters moved from `config.xml` to `projectforge.properties`
.. `config.xml:currencySymbol` -> `projectforge.properties:projectforge.currencySymbol=â‚¬`
.. `config.xml:defaultLocale` -> `projectforge.properties:projectforge.defaultLocale=en`
.. `config.xml:defaultTimeNotation` -> `projectforge.properties:projectforge.defaultTimeNotation=H24`
.. `config.xml:firstDayOfWeek` -> `projectforge.properties:projectforge.defaultFirstDayOfWeek=MONDAY`
.. `config.xml:excelPaperSize` -> `projectforge.properties:projectforge.excelPaperSize=DINA4`

. PhoneLookupServlet moved from `phoneLookup` to `rsPublic/phoneLookup`
