# ProjectForge - project management solution

ProjectForge is a web-based solution for project management including time tracking, team calendar, gantt-charting, financial administration, issue management,
controlling and managing work-break-down-structures (e. g. together with JIRA as issue management system).

## Quickstart from command line

> Please note: You only need the following steps for developing ProjectForge.
> If you just want to run it, please download it from https://sourceforge.net/projects/pforge/

1. Checkout:  
   https://github.com/micromata/projectforge.git
2. Build ProjectForge:  
   `mvn clean install -DskipTests=true`
3. Change Directory:  
    `cd projectforge-application`
4. Run ProjectForge:  
   `java -jar target/projectforge-application-X.X.X.jar`
5. Open your browser:  
   http://localhost:8080

Start with own config location: `java -jar target/projectforge-application-X.X.X.jar --spring.config.additional-location=file:~/ProjectForge/application-default.properties`

### Quickstart with Eclipse and maven

1. Launch eclipse
2. Import Maven project -> pom.xml in projectforge git root dir
3. Import Maven project -> pom.xml in projectforge-application dir
3. Start by simply running main (in projectforge-application/src/main/java):  
   org.projectforge.start.ProjectForgeApplication.java

Please note the detailed documentations for administrators, developers as well as for users.

Java version 8 is required since ProjectForge 6.0.
Please note, that Java version 8 is needed for developing and running ProjectForge.

## Adding your own plugins
ProjectForge support plugins. The existing menu can be modified and own entities and functionalities can be added.

The menu is customizable (you can add or remove menu entries in the config.xml file).
Deploy your plugins by adding your jar(s) to the plugin directory next to the jar file. In eclipse you have to add the plugin project to the run configuration classpath. The jars contains both, the Java classes and the web pages (Wicket-pages). Nothing more is needed.
Register your plugins in the administration menu at the web gui. You need to restart the server.
One advantage is that your own plugins are independent from new releases of the ProjectForge core system. In one of the next releases an example plugin will show you how easy it is to extend ProjectForge!

## Quickstart with PostgreSQL

### Using PostgresSQL (Docker)

Choose and set a database password: `export PGPASSWORD=mypassword`

.Table Install PostgreSQL
|===
|Initialize and run|`docker run --name projectforge-postgres -p 127.0.0.1:15432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$PGPASSWORD -e POSTGRES_USER=projectforge -d postgres:11.2`
|Stop|`docker stop projectforge-postgres`
|Start|`docker start projectforge-postgres`
|Import dump|`docker run -v ~/ProjectForgeBackup/pf.sql:/mnt/pf.sql -e PGPASSWORD=$PGPASSWORD -it --rm --link projectforge-postgres:postgres postgres:11.2 psql -h postgres -U projectforge -q -f /mnt/pf.sql  2>&1 > log.txt`
|Reset passwords|`update t_pf_user SET password='SHA{BC871652288E56E306CFA093BEFC3FFCD0ED8872}', password_salt=null, email='m.developer@acme.com';`
|PSQL|`docker run -e PGPASSWORD=$PGPASSWORD -it --rm --link projectforge-postgres:postgres postgres:11.2 psql -h postgres -U postgres`
|Uninstall|`docker rm projectforge-postgres`
